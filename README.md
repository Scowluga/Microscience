The official application of Microcomputer Science Centre Inc. Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scowluga.android.microscience&hl=en">here</a> from the Google Play Store. 

## About the Application 
Created during my co-op term, the Microscience application provides various functionality to patrons, and promotes the centre through select featured products. See <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scowluga.android.microscience&hl=en">The Google Play Store</a> for details, more information, and to download. 

The application is created with Android Studio. Python was used to parse data and create the list of autocomplete names in the <i>Products</i> section, and the <i>News</i> section retrieves data from WordPress through the WordPress REST API and filter feeds plugins.
